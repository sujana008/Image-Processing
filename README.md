High Pass & Low Pass filtering using OpenCV/NumPy, developed in Google Colab (CSE420 project).
# Image Processing Filters for MRI Analysis (CSE420)

A comparative implementation of **High Pass and Low Pass image filters** for medical imaging analysis, developed in **Google Colab** as part of the **CSE420 (Image Processing)** final project.

## Research Context
This work supports experiments described in our project report:
**"Impact of Neighborhood-based Preprocessing on Brain Metastasis Detection in MRI: A Comparative Study"**  
Co-authors: *Rudrodeb Sarker, Shrabon Das, Sujana Shahrin*.

## Implemented Filters
- **High Pass Filter** → Enhances edges, lesion boundaries
- **Low Pass Filter** → Reduces noise, smoothens textures

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab Notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- ResNet-based MRI classification (report reference)

##  How to Run
1. Upload the `.ipynb` file to Google Colab
2. Add an input MRI/image file
3. Run all cells sequentially
